**1. Briefly discuss how you implemented the LS functionality of
   tracking which TS responded to the query and timing out if neither
   TS responded.
-

**2. Are there any known issues or functions that are not working?**
- In project 2, I had a good bit of trouble implementing the part where if there is an invalid host,
  it outputs an error message, so that still doesn't work after spending quite a bit of time on it.

- Additionally, we could not figure out how to implement the timeout function. Tried to implement a multithreading
  function and a multiprocessing function and neither would work properly so I completely removed it for
  simplicity's sake.

**3. What problems did you face developing code for this project?**
- As indicated above, we had a hard time implementing some of the functionality in terms of the timeout and host error.
  Additionally, Karneet's laptop died while making changes that had to be recoded as it was lost. 


**4. Around how long did you spend on this project?**
20 hours
