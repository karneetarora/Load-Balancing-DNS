**1. Briefly discuss how you implemented the LS functionality of tracking which TS responded to the query and timing out if neither
   TS responded.
    - LS: for the load balancing, we used the hash() function %2. By using %2, we only get 0 or 1,
    allowing us to either send the hostname query to TS1 or TS2 respectively. Now in order to 
     ensure a repeated hostname is sent to the same server, we hashed the specific index of a given
     hostname. It seems to be that the load is fairly balanced between the two TS servers. We tried
     to implement the timing function/window, but it was quite difficult. We looked into using
     the time() function and stamping the start time prior to each request made by LS to a TS server,
     however, it was very tough to get the program to stop waiting for a response from the server. We tried
     to use a for loop which check the current timestamp to the start time of query, but this 
     proved to be very inaccurate and not consistent. We looked into the multithreading
     so we could have two requests being done at the same time, one thread would be to search
     for the hostname and the other would keep track of time, but this proved to be difficult
     as well and we were unable to implement a timeout window.

**2. Are there any known issues or functions that are not working?**
- In project 2, I had a good bit of trouble implementing the part where if there is an invalid host,
  it outputs an error message, so that still doesn't work after spending quite a bit of time on it.
  We implemented a clause so it checks for a empty return message from a TS server, indicating it
  wasn't found/is invalid, but we stil struggled to get it display the error hsotname.

- Additionally, we could not figure out how to implement the timeout function. Tried to implement a multithreading
  function and a multiprocessing function and neither would work properly so I completely removed it for
  simplicity's sake.

**3. What problems did you face developing code for this project?**
- As indicated above, we had a hard time implementing some of the functionality in terms of the timeout and host error.
  Additionally, Karneet's laptop crashed while making changes that had to be recoded as it was lost.
  He ended up buying a new laptop and had to reload all programs (inlcuding python itself), software, and files.


**4. Around how long did you spend on this project?**
20 hours
