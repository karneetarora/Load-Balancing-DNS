Overview:
+++++++++
There are four programs: 
  1. Client
  2. Load-Balancing
  3. Server (LS)
  4. Two DNS Servers (TS1 and TS2)

The client program makes the query (in the form of a hostname) to the LS. 
LS then forwards the query to one of the servers, either TS1 or TS2. 
LS must forward the same hostname to the same TS server as before 
LS forwards aproximatly half of the queries to each server (TS1 or TS2), so the load is around equal. 


Load Balancer(LS) design:
+++++++++
The LS uses a hashing function to split the client's queries evenly and sends to one of the two servers.


TS design:
+++++++++
There are two TS servers which each maintain a DNS table consisting of
2 fields:
- Hostname
- IP address(s)

For each query received from the LS, each TS server first checks its DNS table.
If the domain name is in its DNS table, it responds to the LS server immediatly.
If the hostname's IP address is not in the local table, TS1 asks google (8.8.8.8) and TS2 asks cloudflare (1.1.1.1).


How to Run Program:
+++++++++
The programs must work with the following command lines:
  python ts1.py ts1ListenPort
  python ts2.py ts2ListenPort
  python ls.py lsListenPort ts1Hostname ts1ListenPort ts2Hostname ts2ListenPort
  python client.py lsHostname lsListenPort
